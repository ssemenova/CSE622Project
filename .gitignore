What files should be in my .gitignore for an Android Studio project?

I've seen several examples that all include .iml but IntelliJ docs say that .iml must be included in your source control.
git android-studio gitignore

Updated to Android Studio 3.0 Please share missing items in comments.

A late answer but none of the answers here and here was right on the money for us...

So, here's our gitignore file:

#built application files
*.apk
*.ap_

# files for the dex VM
*.dex

# Java class files
*.class

# generated files
bin/
gen/

# Local configuration file (sdk path, etc)
local.properties

# Windows thumbnail db
Thumbs.db

# OSX files
.DS_Store

# Android Studio
*.iml
.idea
#.idea/workspace.xml - remove # and delete .idea if it better suit your needs.
.gradle
build/
.navigation
captures/
output.json 

#NDK
obj/
.externalNativeBuild
